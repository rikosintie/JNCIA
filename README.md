# Resources
Juniper offers a 7 hour video training course called [MIGRATING FROM THE CISCO CCNA TO THE JNCIA-JUNOS](https://learningportal.juniper.net/juniper/user_activity_info.aspx?id=EDU-JUN-WBT-JOL-CCNA-JNCIA-JUNOS). As always, you have to create an account. Unlike Cisco, you have to use a corporate email address, they won't accept Google, Apple, etc OAUTH.

When you complete the training they send you an email with an offer to take a sample exam up to 3 times. If you get a 70% or better, they send you a coupon for 75% off of the $200 Pearson exam!

[Getting Started with Networking](https://learningportal.juniper.net/juniper/user_activity_info.aspx?id=769)  
If you are new to networking you should watch these. If you are a CCNA or better at least review because there are L2/L3 and IP addressing questions on the exam.

## Additional Resources
Juniper offers quite a bit of free material to study from. Here are the ones I know about. Once you create a Learning Portal account you get access to several communitites. None are dedicated to the exams, but they are good for general knowledge. There is a dedicated [twitter](https://twitter.com/JuniperCertify) certification account.

# Software Release Types
[Junos OS Release Numbers](https://www.juniper.net/documentation/us/en/software/junos/junos-install-upgrade/topics/topic-map/software-install-and-upgrade-overview.html)  
* **R** First revenue ship (FRS) or maintenance release software. R1 is FRS. R2 onward are maintenance releases.  
* F Feature velocity release. Feature velocity releases are only in Junos OS Release 15.1. 
* **B** Beta release software.  
*  **I** Internal release software. These are private software releases for verifying fixes.  
* **S** Service release software, which are released to customers to solve a specific problem—this release will be maintained along with the life span of the underlying release. The service release number is added after the R number, for example, 14.2R3-S4.4. Here S4 represents the 4th service release on top of 14.2R3 and is the 4th re-spin.  
* **X** Special (eXception) release software. X releases follow a numbering system that differs from the standard release numbering.

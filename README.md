# Resources
Juniper offers a 7 hour video training course called [MIGRATING FROM THE CISCO CCNA TO THE JNCIA-JUNOS](https://learningportal.juniper.net/juniper/user_activity_info.aspx?id=EDU-JUN-WBT-JOL-CCNA-JNCIA-JUNOS). As always, you have to create an account. Unlike Cisco, you have to use a corporate email address, they won't accept Google, Apple, etc OAUTH.

When you complete the training they send you an email with an offer to take a sample exam up to 3 times. If you get a 70% or better, they send you a coupon for 75% off of the $200 Pearson exam!

## Additional Resources
Juniper offers quite a bit of free material to study from. Here are the ones I know about. Once you create a Learning Portal account you get access to several communitites. None are dedicated to the exams, but they are good for general knowledge. There is a dedicated [twitter](https://twitter.com/JuniperCertify) certification account.
